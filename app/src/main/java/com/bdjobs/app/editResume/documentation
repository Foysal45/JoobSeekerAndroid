** Structure
    1. Create and start an activity for each of the module like i.e. Personal Details, Education and Training, Employment History and others.
    2. Create sub modules of the individual modules using fragment and transact them using the previously defined method 'transitFragment(param1,param2,param3)'
        which is mentioned in extensions.kt (will be found in the project)
    3. Try to declare all main and common methods into the specific activity, check the developed module if needed
    4. Use interface to build interactions between 'fragment to activity' or 'fragment to fragment'
    5. Try to develop business logic and other backend threads into the belonging activity using the MVP pattern for each module

** Control
    1. Each fragments or sub modules of the project is basically controlled by it's own base activity
    2. Navigation Back button is used to transit fragments which is back stacked previously
    3. To prevent lists and data to be loaded frequently instead of loading only when data is already updated is basically defined
        into each fragment onResume() methods using a constant value for each fragment state.
    4. Network calls and other stuffs are situated inside onResume() method with some conditional statements.
    5. The total control is being established in each activity created for each module
